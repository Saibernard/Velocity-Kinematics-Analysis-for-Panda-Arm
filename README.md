# Velocity-Kinematics-Analysis-for-Panda-Arm
This repository contains velocity kinematics for a simplified 6-DOF Panda robot arm. Derived Jacobian matrix, implemented forward and inverse velocity kinematics, and extensively tested in simulation and hardware. Report includes analysis of singularities and trajectory tracking.
